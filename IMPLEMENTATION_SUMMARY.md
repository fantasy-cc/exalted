## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
GitHub Actions (Every 5 min) 
    ‚Üì (Scrapes POE2Scout)
Commits JSON to repo
    ‚Üì (Triggers deployment)
Vercel auto-deploys
    ‚Üì (Serves data)
Users get live data!
```

### Key Benefits:

- ‚úÖ **$0/month cost** - Completely free!
- ‚úÖ **No Playwright in serverless** - Works perfectly on Vercel
- ‚úÖ **Fast API responses** - <100ms (reading static files)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic updates** - Every 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Version controlled** - Full history of data changes
- ‚úÖ **Reliable** - GitHub Actions has 99.9% uptime

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/[your-username]/exalted
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Enable workflows if not already enabled
4. You should see "Scrape POE2Scout Currency Data" workflow

### Step 2: Test the Workflow

1. Click on the workflow
2. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
3. Watch it run (takes ~2 minutes)
4. Check for green checkmark ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Verify Data Files

1. Navigate to `api/data/` in your repository
2. You should see updated:
   - `currencies.json`
   - `rates.json`
3. Check commit history for automated commits

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

All the files are created locally. You need to commit and push them:

```bash
cd /Users/lfan/exalted

# Stage all new and modified files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "‚ú® Implement GitHub Actions architecture (Option 3A)

- Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated scraping
- Create Playwright scraper script
- Add static data API (serverless-compatible)
- Update documentation
- Completely free deployment!"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Watch the Magic Happen

1. GitHub Actions will start running automatically
2. Every 5 minutes, it will:
   - Scrape POE2Scout.com
   - Update JSON files
   - Commit changes
   - Trigger Vercel deployment
3. Your site will always have fresh data!

## üîç Verification Checklist

Use this to verify everything is working:

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Data files exist: `api/data/currencies.json` and `api/data/rates.json`
- [ ] Automated commits appear in repository
- [ ] Vercel site loads without errors
- [ ] Visit `/api/health` - shows recent timestamp
- [ ] Currency dropdown shows 20+ currencies (after first scrape)
- [ ] Arbitrage calculations work
- [ ] No console errors in browser (F12)

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Before First Scrape:
- 3 currencies (placeholder data)
- Basic exchange rates
- Works but limited

### After First Scrape (2-3 minutes):
- 20-50 currencies (all from POE2Scout)
- Complete exchange rate matrix
- Real arbitrage opportunities
- Live market data!

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### GitHub Actions Fails

1. Check the workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Common issues:
   - Playwright installation failed
   - POE2Scout.com is down
   - Network timeout

### Vercel Shows Old Data

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for auto-deployment
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status

### API Returns Errors

1. Check that data files exist
2. Verify files contain valid JSON
3. Check Vercel function logs
